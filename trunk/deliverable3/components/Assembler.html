						Our GUI contains two panels: One to display the contents of the .asm input file,
						and one to display the contents of our output which is the generated mif file. 
						When the user enters the .asm file, it is displayed on the .asm panel. When the user
						chooses to generate the .mif file, the user is prompted for a location to save.
						Once the user specifies a save file, the text of the generated .mif file is displayed
						on the .mif textarea. 
						<br><br>
						<img alt="GUI Screenshot" src="images/gui.png">
						<br>
						It is possible that our GUI will throw exceptions if an incorrect type of input
						file is provided, but it is important to note that the scope of the assembler is to handle
						a .asm file that is designed to be assembled by the Cache_Money assembler and the output
						is designed to work on the Cache_Money processor, using only the Cache_Money instruction set.

<a name="Parsing"></a>	2. Instruction Parsing + Instruction and data layout &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">(Back to top)</a>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td style="padding-left:25px;" align=justify>
						The instruction parsing of the assembler works such that first all comments, denoted
						by text following a pound symbol, are removed from the code.
						<br><br>
						Once the comments are removed from the lines, the parsing can begin. First, the assembler begins
						by making one pass through the file, only to resolve symbolic references and their addresses.
						Symbolic references may include:
						<ul>
							<li>References corresponding to a specific instruction (address) in code.<br>
								i.e. symbolicAddress: add $1, $2, $3</li>
							<li>References corresponding to values in the .data section. - <i>These will be covered in a later section</i><br>
								i.e. numberOne: .integer 1
						</ul><br>
						Symbolic addresses are determined first when parsing an assembly file because certain instructions (lw, sw, addi) will need
						to be able to use these, and must know the address associated with the specific symbol.
						<br><br>
						Once the symbolic references are parsed, the instructions are next.  The assembler then makes another pass
						through the assembly file, generating instructions from the assembly code.
						<br><br>
						Finally, once the parsing of the assembly file is finished, the MIF (memory initializtion file can be produced).
						The MIF file must first begin with several header lines.
						<ul>
							<li>WIDTH - The width of the word at each address in memory.</li>
							<li>DEPTH - The number of addressable words in memory.</li>
							<li>ADDRESS_RADIX - The radix of the addresses in memory.</li>
							<li>DATA_RADIX - The radix of the values in memory</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						For our MIF file, we have chosen to set WIDTH = 32 bits.  This is necessary because our instruction
						width is 32 bits, and all data values in memory are also 32 bits.  Since we have 512 KB of available
						SRAM space, we calculated that 131,072 32-bit words could reside within the SRAM.  Therefore, we have
						set our DEPTH = 131072.
					
						
						<br><br>
						<!--
						The instruction parsing of the assembler works such that first all comments, denoted
						by text following a pound symbol, are removed from the code. The .mif file starts
						out with the initialization lines which define the width and depth our code. The width
						is the same as the number of bits of our instruction (32 bits) and the depth is (512*2^13)/32
						 = 131072 bits!
						<br>
						<br>
						Once the comments are removed and the initialization lines are added, the assembler 
						calculates the symbolic addresses, then the instructions are parsed, converting them from
						assembly code to byte code which can then be interpreted by our processor. The symbolic
						addresses are determined first because certain instructions (lw, sw, and addi) will need
						to know where from to fetch/place values in memory.
						<br>
						<br>-->
						The .asm file is to be organized so that instructions come first, and the data section second, which is specified 
						by the '.data' header.  This structureis absolutely necessary for the assembler to create the correct MIF file.
						
						<br>
						<h4>The Data Section</h4>
						Two specific data types can be stored in the data section.
						<ul>
							<li>Integers - specified by '.integer', which contain a single integer value.</li>
							<li>Arrays of Integers - specified by '.array', consisting of multiple values, separated by commas.</li>
						</ul>
						Data Types are in fact another type of symbolic reference, and can be instanciated as such:<br>
						numberOne: .integer 1<br>
						arrayOfValues: .array 3,4,2342,-12128,2343,2,1,12,4214<br>
						
						
						<!--There are two types of symbolic references as identified by our assembler,
						".array" which consist of several values delimited by commas and ".integer" which consists of
						a single integer value.-->
						
						<h4>Example Usage of Symbolic References and Data Types</h4>
						In the case of matrix multiplication, the user will first specify the assembly code
						that will perform the matrix multiplication computations, followed by the data section. The data section is
						specified by a line that reads ".data" followed by the data itself.<br>
						The data section could consist of several variables.  First, the 'size' variable (an integer), would denote the dimension of the matrices, since
						we will be dealing only with square matrices in this project.  This would denote 'n' for an 'n' x 'n' matrix.
						Next, the matrices would be specified, using variables 'matrix1' and 'matrix2' (both arrays).  This will define each matrix sequentially in
						memory, row by row, left to right.<br>
						An example of these variables is shown here<br>
						<pre>add $3, $0, $1<br>#...<br>#...<br>.data #specifies the beginning of the data section<br>size: .integer 3<br>matrix1: .array 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9<br>matrix2: .array 3,6,5,4,7,8,9,4,1<br>matrix3: .integer 0</pre>
						<img src="images/matricies.jpg"><br>
						(Note here that having matrix3 after matrix2 simply lets us know where to store the
						 computed values as we are performing the matrix multiplication)<br><br>
						In order to access the base address of a variable/symbolic reference, we have modified the 'addi' instruction so that if
						a user specifies a symbolic reference location to add to a register, the value that will go in the 
						immediate field will be the address of the symbolic reference. For example, the following instruction:
						<pre>addi $29, $0, matrix1	#Load the base address of the first matrix</pre>
						would add the address of 'matrix1' in memory to register $0, and would translate to the following byte code:
						<pre>1 : 00111101000000000000000000011011;</pre>
						Where the last 19-bits represent the immediate field. In this case, the last bits represent the address
						of matrix1 which is 11011 (binary) -> 1B (hex). Line 1B is as follows in the .mif output file:
						<pre>1B : 00000000000000000000000000000001;</pre>
