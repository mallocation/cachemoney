<h2>Cache Money Processor</h2>

Our processor was written to perform matrix multiplication on two square matrices, up to dimensions of size 10.<br />
Then, the sum of the diagonal of the resulting matrix will be calculated, and displayed on the LCD.  This program<br />
can be found here: <a href="matrixmult.asm">Matrix Multiplication Program</a>

<br />
<br />
Our assembler can be downloaded here: <a href="Assembler.jar">Cache Money Assembler</a><br/>
**Please note** This assembler assumes the assembly program is properly formatted.  This version does not offer error reporting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a high-level view of our five stage pipeline.<br />

You may obtain a copy of the Quartus project containing all of the design files for our processor.  All of our design<br />
was done using subversion.  To obtain the design files / schematics, please use a subversion client to check out<br />
the project from subversion.<br /><br />
