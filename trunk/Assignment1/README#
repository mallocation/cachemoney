**** Assignment Instructions ****	
For the first part of the assignment (Working with BCEL), all files necessary can be found
in the 'WorkingWithBCEL' directory.


For the second part of the assignment (A Dynamic Operator Mutator Program), the necessary
files can be found in the "Included files" section above.
The 'ChangeOp' program is located in ChangeOp.java and meets the specifications as described
in the assignment handout.  The '.cInstructionHelper.java' file contains a helper class to 
the ChangeOp program.
Finally, the bcel library is included in the bcel-5.2.jar file.

To run the 'ChangeOp' program, you must first set the CLASSPATH to include the bcel-5.2.jar 
library.

	setenv CLASSPATH .:bcel-5.2.jar
	
Then, compile the ChangeOp program by:
	
	javac ChangeOp.java
	
Finally, you may run the ChangeOp program using the format below:

	java ChangeOp classname old_operator new_operator
	
Any specifics to the operation of this program are listed in the handout for this programming
assignment, (including the need to insert single quotes to allow the * operator to be changed).
For example,

	java ChangeOp ClassToMutate '*' /
